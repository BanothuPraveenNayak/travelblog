            <h2>Top Travel Tips for a Smooth Journey</h2>

            <article class="tip">
                <h3>1. Plan Ahead</h3>
                <li>Research your destination thoroughly before you go. Knowing the local customs, transportation options, and major attractions can save you time and avoid unnecessary stress. Be sure to also make copies of important documents like your passport
                    and travel insurance.</li>

            <article class="tip">
                <h3>2. Pack Light and Smart</h3>
                <li>When packing, aim for versatility in your clothing. Pack items that can be layered, mixed, and matched. Roll your clothes to save space and bring only the essentials to avoid heavy luggage. A first-aid kit, power bank, and reusable water
                    bottle are also must-haves.</li>

            <article class="tip">
                <h3>3. Stay Healthy</h3>
                <li>Traveling can expose you to new climates, food, and environments. To stay healthy, drink bottled water in regions where the tap water isn’t safe, eat at reputable restaurants, and don’t forget to get vaccinations if needed. Staying hydrated
                    and getting enough rest is essential during your trip.</li>

                <h3>4. Be Money-Wise</h3>
                <li>Make sure to notify your bank about your travel plans so your card doesn’t get blocked while abroad. Carry a combination of cards and some local currency. Be mindful of international transaction fees and always keep an eye on exchange
                    rates.
                </li>

                    <h3>5. Stay Safe</h3>
                    <li>Prioritize your safety by staying aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded tourist areas. Avoid flaunting expensive items like jewelry, and keep your belongings secure. It’s always a good idea to research which areas are safe
                        for tourists in your destination.</li>

                <article class="tip">
                    <h3>6. Embrace the Local Culture</h3>
                    <li>One of the best parts of travel is experiencing new cultures. Learn a few phrases in the local language, try local cuisine, and be respectful of the traditions and practices of the place you’re visiting. This not only enhances your
                        experience but also fosters positive connections with locals.</li>

                    <h3>7. Use Travel Apps</h3>
                    <li>Travel apps can make your journey much smoother. Download apps like Google Maps, a translation app, and apps to help you find restaurants, attractions, and transportation. Having offline access to maps and travel guides can be a lifesaver
                        when you don’t have internet access.</li>

                    <h3>8. Keep Track of Your Itinerary</h3>
                    <li>While it’s great to be spontaneous, having a basic itinerary will help you stay organized and ensure you don’t miss any must-see spots. Keep a digital or physical copy of your travel plans, accommodation details, and any tickets or
                        reservations you’ve made.</li>
